/**
 * Write a client program Subset.java that takes a command-line integer k,
 * reads in a sequence of N strings from standard input using
 * StdIn.readString(), and prints out exactly k of them, uniformly at random.
 * Each item from the sequence can be printed out at most once.
 * You may assume that k â‰¥ 0 and no greater than the number of string
 * on standard input.
 *
 * Your client should use only constant space plus one object either of
 * type Deque or of type RandomizedQueue; use generics properly to avoid
 * casting and compiler warnings. It should also use time and space
 * proportional to at most N in the worst case, where N is the number
 * of strings on standard input. (For an extra challenge, use space
 * proportional to k.)
